# Hello HSBKK Coders!

This is the first coding module of every first year technical students. Hope you enjoy learning how to **properly** code along the way.

Rules:
    - LLM use is allowed, but you need to understand the code it provides; otherwise, it is your loss of growing to a better programmer.
    - Code copied from other sources (such as your friend) is allow only if that person teaches you the algorithm, logic, and meaning underneath that code. If not, we have the rights to report such actions to the academic boards.
    - All submitted code should be done according to the guidelines we provided, such as PEP8, Zen of Python, naming meaningful variables. Otherwise, those code will be treated as violating the rules set by the class.
    - An attempt to submit the code after the deadline cannot be amended, as the code submission timestamp is shown as a committed date and time.

Here are the course outline (This is not generated by any LLM).
    - Session 1: Getting to know each other/ what is python, PEP8, Zen of Python? / human robot workshop.
    - Session 2: Intro to Python programming, `print(), comment, int, float, str, bool, None`
